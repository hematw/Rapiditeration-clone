                        <p>Building great products is hard. Most new products fail. But what if there was a way to
                            improve
                            your chances of success? In his book "The Lean Product Playbook," entrepreneur and Lean
                            product
                            expert Dan Olsen lays out a repeatable, easy-to-follow methodology for iterating your way to
                            product-market fit. I recently read the book and shared my notes and understanding in a
                            webinar,
                            and I'm excited to share the key takeaways with you in this blog post.</p>

                            <p class="small">What platforms such as Saas and Low/ No Code bring to the table is the
                                absence of such
                                infrastructures and 99.999% availability. The NGOs do not need to bother about the
                                whereabouts of the underlying infrastructure. Not only that but also, these Saas
                                platforms do not require very highly skilled labor, they are made easily and are way
                                less complicated compared to the in-house, custom-made software solutions.</p>
